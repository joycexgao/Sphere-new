  <div class="page-section container">
    <h3 class="section-title text-muted text-uppercase">more user feedback</h3>
    <p class="small-point">After addressing the previous round of feedback, we submitted our <a style="color:#7D5BA6; text-decoration-color:#7D5BA6;" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/5pyXDKUuQq3LRG3VyRRnbe/Iterative-Design?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=191%3A2402&viewport=1601%2C-148%2C0.61&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=191%3A2402" target="_blank">mockup v2.0</a> to <a style="color:#7D5BA6; text-decoration-color:#7D5BA6;" href="https://www.usertesting.com/" target="_blank">usertesting.com</a>.</p>
    <p class="small-point">
      Unlike our peers, the users who tested our prototype on usertesting.com are all around 30 years of age, which is closer to the demographics of Sphere’s target audience. These users helped us locate problems that did not arise during the first round of user testing.

    <div class="container textbox small-point" style="padding: 1rem 3rem; ">
      <light>All users were confused by the <b>lack of labels in the navigation bar</b> to varying degrees</light>
      <light><b>The association between the star icon and "instructor" is unclear.</b> For instance, one user thought it means “favorite”</light>
      <light>Users were confused by the lack of navigation from the livestream page to the course page
      </light>
    </div>
    <p class="small-point" style="padding-top:1rem;">
      <b>Overall, all users found the interface very easy to learn!</b> They also found it natural to directly reach out to an instructor, which is important for Sphere's focus on building an interactive learning community.

    <div class="page-section container">
      <h3 class="section-title text-muted text-uppercase">conclusions & lessons</h3>
      <bullet class="small-point">
        <b>Feedback is important in making sure that every aspect of the design is intentional.</b> In this project, peer and user feedback for the first two mockups picked out many design choices that were not thoroughly considered from a user perspective.
      </bullet>
      <bullet class="small-point"><b>Finding the right demographics of users is crucial!</b> Because of the structure of the course assignment, our first round of user feedback came from tech-savvy students. For them, the unlabeled navigation bar does not hinder learnability, but it poses a difficulty for a slightly older user demographic. 
      </bullet>
      <bullet class="small-point">
        <b>If users are expected to learn something, the instruction should be clear and obvious.</b> Users did not pick up our attempt to establish an association between the star icon and “instructor”, because the signal is too subtle. 
      </bullet>
    </div>

    <div class="page-section container">
      <h3 class="section-title text-muted text-uppercase">Things I would do differently
      </h3>
      <bullet class="small-point">
        If this were a real project commissioned by Sphere, <b>I would inquire more about the livestreaming concept.</b> In our research, although we found evidence in support of livestream lessons, we also found evidence against it, the most important of which is time flexibility. 
      </bullet>
      <bullet class="small-point">
        <b>Do user testing on people who more closely resemble the target users.</b> Due to the design of this assignment, our first round of feedback came from our peers, who can have a pretty different perspective from our target users.
